# {{ page.title }}

I'm a mechatronics engineeer at [Mayfield Robotics](http://www.mayfieldrobotics.com/) by day and [Hackaday Writer](http://hackaday.com/about/) on some nights.

I started these pages with the thought that I'd have a "home base" to collect some ideas before they autonomously roll off my desk.
Engineering doesn't seem to come without it's "growing pains," and while I just finished college a little more than a year ago, I'm still growing into my boots. I'd be honored to take your feedback if there are places where I'm entirely missing the mark.

Lastly, keep me posted if there's anything I can clarify--or if these notes lead you into building something awesome!

# about this website
Gone are the days when documenting projects was a hard-coded html hassle.
With a big hand from the [Jekyll](Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) project, documenting projects has been streamlined into writing simple markdown files and dropping images into a directory.
Feel free to drop me a note if you have any questions about the mechanics of how this site was assembled.
