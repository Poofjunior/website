      <h1>Lab Exercise 1: Basic Inputs and Outputs</h1>
      <h2> The Preamble </h2>
        <p> 
Welcome to digital design with the Arduino!  Arduino is a microcontroller 
excellent for small electronics projects.  In the past, Arduino’s have nestled 
themselves into projects from blinking LEDs to flying quadcopters.  Like other 
microcontrollers, the Arduino is best at sending and receiving electrical 
signals.  With this ability, you, the designer, can interact with the world by 
driving signals to turn on lights, motors, sounds, based on the sensory input 
around you.
        <h3> Important: The Lab Format </h3>
These Labs are formatted into two partitions: a <b>tutorial</b> and a <b>deliverable</b>.  
The tutorials are designed to give you one or more fundamental skills for the 
week.  The deliverable is your way of demonstrating that you can create a 
project based on the tutorial we’ve provided for you. <i>You aren’t required to 
complete the tutorial, but you must turn in the deliverable.</i>  Many of the 
tutorials will involve creating a lot of hardware on a breadboard; thus, to 
save you time, the deliverable will derive itself from a very similar circuit. 
Unless you're strongly familiar with the Arduino Programming Language already, 
we highly recommend that you work through the tutorial.  Along the way, we’ll 
also provide you with helpful references to further your knowledge in the 
related section.
      <h2> 1. Digital Output: Blinking that LED </h2>
        <h3> Two Design Aspects </h3>
            <h4> The Hardware </h4>
                <h5> Breadboard Basics </h5>
<p>
Take a look at your breadboard's hole pattern.  Breadboards are designed to
have each of their inner rows electrically connected, and to have each of their outer 
columns electrically connected.  Thus, by plugging a component into a 
row, you create 4 additional places to connect from it.  To illustrate this
concept, we've covered each distinct electrical connection with a blue wire
in the picture below. <br>

<img src="../../img/breadboard1.png" width=300>

<p>
In general, the red columns will be used for power supplies and the black 
columns will be used as a common ground connection.  In this manner, you 
can easily bring power and ground to any location on your breadboard.

<p>
Now, construct the circuit below exactly as you see it on your breadboard:<br>
<img src="../../img/hardware1.png" >

            <h4> The Software </h4>
<p>
Now, download and install the latest version of the 
<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino Programming Language Software</a>,
and open the "blink.ino" sketch from the examples folder: <br>
<img src="../../img/blink.png" width=450>

        <h3> The Breakdown </h3>
<p>
Now, let's break down our code line-by-line:<br>
<img src="../../img/setup.png" >
<p> The function <b>setup</b> is called once at the very beginning. </br>
<img src="../../img/loop.png" >
<p> The function <b>loop</b> is then called repeatedly until the power is turned off. </br>
<p> When you feel comfortable about this code's functionality, change pin 13, to pin 0, and click the upload button to upload it to your plugged in Arduino.
<img src="../../img/upload.png" > </br>
<p> Congrats!  You've just completed your first Arduino project!  Note that the function <b>loop</b> begins immediately after it ends.
        <h3> Writing your own Functions </h3>
<p> Arduino syntax is fairly well-documented.  If you're ever wondering <i>how to write something in code</i>, take a look a the  
<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage">Arduino Reference Page</a> for syntax and usage of Arduino's functions. 
      <h2> 2. Digital Input: Adding a Push-Button</h2>
<p> For digital input, we'll add a push-button.  This push-button is a <i>momentary-on</i> push-button, which means that the circuit will be <b>closed</b> (connected) when the button is pushed and <b>open</b> (not connected) when the button is released.
Modify your circuit below by adding a push-button.  Notice that we're creating a separate loop from power to ground.  The Arduino watches the voltage level just below the pin with the newly-added white wire. </br>
<img src="../../img/pushButton.png" > </br>
<p> A push-button provides digital input (either <b>on</b> or <b>off</b>) that the Arduino can detect.  To do so, we'll call upon the 
<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/DigitalRead">digitalRead</a> function. 
<p> Take a look at the function's documentation, and copy-and-paste the example code into a blank Arduino sketch window.  Change <i> pin 13</i> to <i> pin 2 </i> and, upload the code, and give it a run!

      <h2> 3. Analog Output: Pulsing an LED </h2>
        <h3> The Gritty Reality: no real analog output </h3> 
<p>  Alas, the reality of the Digital World is that the Arduino, a digital device, can't produce true analog values as outputs.  In other words, you can't change the brightness of an LED by gradually increasing and decreasing the voltage on the Arduino pin smoothly from 0 to 5 [V].  You can either turn it fully-on (5 [V]) or fully-off (0 [V]).  </br>
<p> Luckily, we can <i>fake it</i>.  For some applications, we can create pseudo-analog voltages by simply turning on and off the Arduino pin very quickly with a pulse train.  By varying <i>how long</i> we keep the Arduino pin on per pulse, we can make the LED appear brighter or darker because your eye integrates the light.  Luckily, this rapid pulsing of the pin is taken care of by Arduino's <b>analogWrite</b> function. </br>

<p> Let's open another example from <i>File --> Examples --> Analog --> Fading </i>.  Also: change the LED pin to pin 9 on the Arduino board. Now upload the code and watch the LED fade. </br>
<p> The good news is that you can quite easily simulate a blinking LED, and with some code tweaks, you can create a "breathing" LED.  The bad news is that the <b>analogWrite</b> function doesn't work on every pin.  Take a look at its 
<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogWrite">documentation</a> before creating your project.
  
      <h2> 4. Serial Communication </h2>
<p>  Lastly, let's talk about communication between the computer and the Arduino.  The Arduino's chip has built-in hardware that can communicate with the computer.  To use it, we call the Arduino's <b>Serial</b> functions. </br> At a slightly deeper level, the Arduino and computer communicate with each other by sending bytes of data to each other.  Very often, we'll want to send over data encoded as text; to do this, we often use the 
<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Char">char</a> datatype. A <i>char</i> is simply a number that represents a particular keyboard character using an encoding called <i> ASCII</i>.  To send chars across the serial line to the computer, you use the 
<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Serial/Println">Serial.println</a> function. 

<p> Let's begin by plugging your Arduino back in and uploading another example. Copy-and-paste the example
<a href="exampleCode/SerialExample/SerialExample.ino">here</a>.

<p> Watch out for a brief note of confusion!  It turns out that the keyboard number keys can also be encoded as 'chars.' If you perform math on this char representation of a number, though, you'll <i>actually</i> be performing math on the numerical encoding of that number. To keep things straight, you'll want to convert your numbers encoded as chars to be their actual numerical counterparts.  Luckily, for the chars 0 through 9, you just need to subtract 48.  If this seems confusing, have a look at the 
<a href="http://www.ascii-code.com/">ASCII encoding of those numbers</a>, which are entries 48 through 57 in this table.  So why is this important?  It turns out that the computer defaults to sending the "char" representation of a number over to the Arduino via the serial monitor window.  Thus, you'll have to decrypt it to get the actual number that you want. 

<p> For a slightly more thorough understanding of Serial Communication, feel free to check out
