      <h2> The Preamble </h2>
        <p> 
    From CAD model to fabrication, this is a test not just of the HMC laser-cutter but more so my 
ability to perform composite layups.  This project began in January 2013, and ended in May.
Without a doubt I owe sincere thanks to the guidance of many others, especially 
<a href="http://www.instructables.com/member/CCotner/">Chris Cotner</a> and Carlo Vaccari, 
two glorious rocket gurus.

<h2> The Build Log </h2>

      <h3> 1. The Motor Mounts</h3>
<p>
    Junk?  I wouldn't be so hasty!  Earlier, a few of us discovered a collection of leftover carbon fiber tubes
about to be scrapped.  Luckily, we were able to save them from the trash! Armed with these tubes,
I aimed to make these the main structure of the arms.  

Despite their lack of weight, carbon-fiber tubes are a structure to be reckoned with.  They're so durable 
that only the machine shop's diamond-engrained bandsaw could cut these without severly eating the blade. 
Unfortunately, tubes are strikingly difficult to join to other structures, so I devised a friction-based 
clamp approach shown below.  
</p>
<img src="../../assets/img/Projects/CarbonFiberMulticopter/images/fullMotorMount.jpg" width=400>
<p>
The mounting plate is humble 1/16th [in] plywood reinforced with 2 layers of 3 [oz] S-Glass and one layer of 
bidirectional carbon fiber scrap.  24 hours of compression after laminating with 
 <a href="http://www.ptm-w.com/">Aeropoxy</a> created an excellent stiff end-result. 
From CAD to final product, the pictures do more justice below:

<p>
Each piece of the layup
(S-glass, plywood, and carbon fiber) was sliced with the laser cutter.  While fiberglass (S-glass) responds
to being laser-cut quite nicely by fusing the threads at the edges of the cut, carbon fiber remains loose 
in thread form.  Hence, the pieces need to be carefully handled after being cut to avoid having the cut piece
fall apart. 
</p>
<h4> Laser-Cutting Carbon Fiber: an aside </h4>
<p>
Cutting carbon fiber alone can be a tricky procedure. Scissors tend to fray
the edges of the cloth, making a mess when attempting to cut out complicated
patterns by hand. 
</p>
<p>
Cutting carbon fiber on the laser cutter simplifies the process greatly, but 
with a few caveats. 
If a few threads remain uncut by the laser, the piece
is essentially impossible to remove without destroying the details as the uncut threads prevent the
piece from leaving the rest of the fabric.  Furthermore, carbon fiber threads scatter and jump away from
the laser as they heat up.
</p>
<p>
The solution? Two passes on the laser cutter.  The first pass should be quick, to 
allow the carbon fiber threads to jump away from the laser cutter and fixate their position.  The next pass
should be very slow so that the beam remains on the same, now fixated carbon fiber threads to fully-cut them.  
I found that on HMC's Epilog 40-watt laser cutter, pass 1 works well at 50 % speed, full power, and pass 2 
works well at 5% speed full power.
</p>


</p>
      <h3> 2. The Frame </h3>
        <h4> The Centerpiece: A Composite Layup Exercise</h4>
<p>
    The Centerpiece is composed of two composite plates with delrin inserts. Almost every one of these  
pieces was sliced on the laser cutter to ensure that the parts fit together snugly. Combined, the
plates and inserts form a compressive sandwich that hold the motor beams in place.  Zippy ties hold 
these plates together, while also providing breakpoints in the event of a nasty crash.
</p>

<p>
Each plate (top and bottom) is fabricated from multiple identical layers of
composite and wood. 1/16th in. plywood provides the base layer, and four layers
of laser-cut 3-oz. fiberglass reinforce this layer. To cure the plates, each 
plate was compressed by a 70-lb. granite slab after being saturated with 
Aeropoxy.

</div>

<p>
Following the initial layers of fiberglass, precut from the laser cutter, I 
placed a top layer of carbon fiber at the top surface of both plates for 
additional rigidity. Unlike the motor mounts, I did not laser cut the carbon
fiber to match the pattern of the center mount. Rather, I performed a layup
with an entire sheet of carbon fiber.  When the epoxy had dried, but not cured
to full strength (i.e: 12 hours later), I used a screwdriver and sharp scissors
to cut the pattern through the carbon fiber, using a printout of the design as
a reference.

      <h3> 3. The Controller Board</h3>
<p>
    Right now, the controller board is an Arduino Clone from Hobbyking designed to be compatible with
the open source <a href="http://www.multiwii.com">MultiWii</a> project.
