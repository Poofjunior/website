<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In fall, 2012, I was admitted to
Harvey Mudd College's Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics, 
<a href="http://newwww.hmc.edu/lair/">LAIR</a>, in its first year of operation. 
Through the ICEX program, I began developing additional hardware for the 
underwater robot platform used on deployments, a Videoray Pro III.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<div class="span9" >
<h4> The Malta Cistern Mapping Project</h4>
</p>
The International Computer Engineering Experience (ICEX) Program is a 
multi-disciplinary, multi-year project focused on the three-dimensional 
mapping of ancient archaeological sites. 
</p>
<p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="../../assets/img/Projects/CANBusDevice/malta.jpg" width=700>
<p>
The country of Malta itself lies just off the coast of Italy. In ancient times, 
it remained a primary target for invaders, as it's location made it an 
excellent stepping stone to the neighboring mainland.  Consequently, a number
of invaders have briefly inhabited the island over the past two-thousand years.
</p>

</div>
<div class="span9" >
<p>
In its most recent years, the ICEX research team has traveled to Malta
to reconstruct submerged ancient cisterns, many of which have not been seen
for over a thousand years. Archaeologists benefit from a project of this
manner as a 3D reconstruction can tell a well-versed archaelogist several 
features about its users, such as their identity and local time period of 
inhabitance.
</p>
<p>
This past year, three fellow classmates, Professor Clark, and I traveled to
Malta to collect data from three cisterns over the course of ten days. 
Overlapping stationary scans were collected within each cistern until we
had ensured full coverage of the cistern using the onboard camera.  
</p>
<p>
During the summer, we published 
<a href="http://newwww.hmc.edu/lair/publications/2013/dobke_UUST_2013.pdf">
Towards Three-Dimensional Mapping without Odometry</a>, a paper describing 
the Lattice Map algorithm.  The algorithm itself performs a least-squares 
fitting on sequential scans based on a probabilistic scan-matching 
approach, ultimately generating a three-dimensional map from the raw data. 
</p>

<h4> The Platform of Choice: a Videoray Pro III</h4>
<img src="../../assets/img/Projects/CANBusDevice/robot.jpg" width="450" align="left" Hspace=10 Vspace=15>
<p>
To navigate the narrow passageways of the ancient cisterns, we deployed a 
Videoray Pro III remotely-operated vehicle (ROV). Traditional control 
involves control through a tethered control box. 
However, the box also features a computer-control feature through a serial
interface. Therefore, our team developed drivers in the Linux-based Robot 
Operating System (ROS) to handle both user-control of the ROV and 
data collection from the sonars.
</p>
<p>
To collect both horizontal
and vertical scans, two Tritech Sonars were mounted perpendicular to each
other at the front of the robot.  In this sense, both horizontal and 
vertical scans could be collected at a single stationary scan point.  
</p>
</div>

<div class="span9">
<h4> The Hardware Development Goal for the 2014 Deployment</h4>
<p>
Currently two sonars are used to collect both horizontal and vertical scans
at a single scan point.  For this reason, scans collected are only sparse
representations of the true features of the cistern, and interpolation is 
required to generate closed three-dimensional maps.  To resolve this issue,
I have prototyped a rotating sonar mount. This project  consists of 
three main components: mechanical design, featuring waterproof hardware; 
electronics hardware design, featuring a fabricated circuit board, 
and a modified software driver to control the additional hardware once 
mounted on the robot. 
</p>

<h3> The Design</h3>
<div class="span9">
<h4> Electronics Hardware Design</h4>
<h5> Parsing the Robot Communication Protocol</h5>
<h5> Adding additional data in fixed data packets</h5>
<h5> A small form-factor PCB</h5>
<center>
<img src="../../assets/img/Projects/CANBusDevice/arduinoCAN_Mod.jpg" width="400" align="middle" Hspace=10 Vspace=15>
</center>
<p>
The hardware task was well-defined: develop a hardware interface to 
probe the CAN Bus communication line without actively replying to 
CAN messages directed at the robot. 
Furthermore, due to the small-form-factor of the sonar mount on the outside of the robot, a small pcb was developed to fit inside the waterproof 
housing.

</div>
<h4> Mechanical Design</h4>
<h5> Designing for Field Wear</h5>
<div class="span9">

<img src="../../assets/img/Projects/CANBusDevice/finalBoxDetail.jpg" width="400" align="left" Hspace=10 Vspace=15>
</div>
<p>
The main lid of the box is fixed with two O-ring seals, with groove depths
calculated with the 
<a href="http://www.parker.com/literature/ORD%205700%20Parker_O-Ring_Handbook.pdf">Parker O-ring Manual</a>.
Since the box would be repeatedly opened for maintenance and inspection
of the circuitry, this particular lid sealing is ideal, as it does not 
induce severe mechanical wear on the box each time it is opened.  
Additionally, no screws are threaded into the plastic housing; rather, 
two bolts apply compressive force from opposing ends of the box.
</p>
<h4> Mechanical Design</h4>
<h5> O-Ring Sealing</h5>
<p>
Two openings pose a threat for leaks on the outside of the waterproof
housing: the shaft opening, where the sonar rotates, and the case opening,
from which the electronics and servo are inserted. To ensure an underwater
seal at a depth of 50 ft, I chose two types of o-ring seals: a ring seal 
for rotating components, and a typical o-ring seal for the lid.
</p>

<h4> Software Driver Modification</h4>
