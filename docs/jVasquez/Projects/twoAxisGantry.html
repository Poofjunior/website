<h3> Introduction</h3>

<p>
This summer, I took some time to learn the ins-and-outs of programming the 
CNC mill.  As a machining tool, it's an incredible upgrade from the manual
milling machines. Rather than having to manually move the mill to a 
particular location, it can be programmed to perform that operation 
automatically. Furthermore, the milling machine can produce arcs and 
pockets, a task well-outside the scope of the manual mills. With the
CNC mill, many projects impossible with the manual mills are now 
realizable with a bit of time and some programming effort.   
</p>


<h4> The Motivation</h4>
<p>
At the same time, I've become fond of creating props with the 
<a href="http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.4/Books/Fundamentals_of_Paper_Model_Design">paper modeling</a>
art style.  paper modeling involves decomposing a 3D model into a separated 2D mesh, 
printing the pattern, and then folding it up into a real-life duplicate of
the model. Of course, this process requires cutting out the printed pattern 
by hand, generally one of the less-exciting steps.  
<p>
The solution?  It turns out that the HMC laser cutter cuts through paper like 
butter! (... er, as we all might've expected.) By exporting the pattern to a .dxf
file, one can skip the tediousness of cutting out the pattern and have a
machine perform this operation more gracefully (and far more precisely) than 
most of our scissor-equipped fingers. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, I'll be departing from Mudd soon, so the only natural permanent 
solution is to build my own paper laser-cutting tool.  
With a bit more time and effort, countless hours can be saved 
from hand-cutting with a glorious laser cutter to do the job automatically.  
</p>

<h4> Mechanical Design and Components</h4> 
<p>
Two-axis gantries aren't new; in fact, companies sell entire "linear motion 
systems" tailored to your particular application.  For the "starving student," 
though, I'll just have to settle with the satisfaction of building my own. 
</p>

<h5> The time-saver: 80/20 Extruded Aluminum Beams </h5>
<p>
Luckily, 
<a href="http://www.mcmaster.com/#80/20-compatible-t-slotted-framing/=oelnix">80/20</a>,
 the "erector set of the engineer," isn't too expensive. (The 
brackets and myriad of connectors are a different story though.) This 
is my first time exploring it as an option. Furthermore, McMaster-Carr provides
 3D Solidworks models of 80/20 and several brackets, a massive time-saving 
when I started developing a 3d model.
</p>

<h5> The H-bot </h5> 
<p>
To move the laser platform along two axes, I've opted for an H-bot design. 
H-bots provide the benefit of two-axis motion with a lighter moving platform
as opposed to other gantries. The reason for the weight-loss? Both motors 
are stationary and neither is located on any of the moving platforms. 
In many extrusive 3D printers, one motor is typically located on one of
the moving axes to move the extruder head. 
</p>

<h3> The Build Log </h3>
<p> I'll admit that the design took a few months CADing designs over and over 
again until I had a build that was machinable, relatively inexpensive, and 
easily to assemble.  For the precision motion, I had discovered a pile of 
hardened rods and bushings on ebay, so I picked those up for far less than I would pay 
from most online retailers. I worked with these rods and bushings as a design 
constraint, about which the rest of the gantry was formed. <p>
<p>
As I soon realized, a number of other components were far out of my
budget.  I also hoped not to spend too long in the machine shop making
custom versions of my own parts that were difficult to reproduce.  To work 
around these constraints, I opted to design parts that didn't require 
a professional skill level to fabricate. </p>   

<h4>DIY Pulleys</h4>

</div>
<br>
With ease-of-reproducability in mind, I discovered a quick way to make DIY pulleys that
simply involved sandwiching two delrin discs over a skate bearing.  I did
machine the shafts, but all of the other components either already existed or
were quickly reproduceable with the laser cutter. The net result works surprisingly 
well.

<h4> Adding Belt Tension</h4>
<div class="span9" >
<img src="../../assets/img/Projects/twoAxisGantry/gantryCenter.jpg" width=500 align="center" Hspace=10>
</div>
<br>
To apply tension to the entire system, I needed a manner of fastening both ends
of the belt together and applying tension to the entire system.  To prevent
myself from buying a complicated part to do this job, I opted for a solution 
similiar to the one shown 
<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31482">here</a>. 
My tensioner also folds the belt over itself to fasten it, but I fixed both
belt ends to separate plates and then joined those plates to a screw for
adjustable tension.   

<h4> Current Status: Septemter 9 </h4>
Currently, the mechanical components for the gantry are complete.  In a few
weeks, I'm hoping to etch a stepper motor driver to drive the two motors.  
In a few months time, I'll have done more research on lasers to find out which
laser to consider and how to keep my eyes safe in the process! Alas, school is 
likely to slow down the work here just a bit though.
