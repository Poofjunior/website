<h3 style="text-align: center;">A Core-XY Implementation </h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">A brief discussion on overcoming
drawbacks in an H-Bot design</h4>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="../../assets/img/Projects/coreXY/gantryFull.jpg" width=700>
</p>

<h3> Introduction</h3>

<p>
After machining an H-Bot, I discovered an inherent issue involved
in moving the platform about a two-dimensional space.  In what follows, I'll
discuss the drawbacks of the H-bot design and then discuss how the Core-XY
overcomes these drawbacks.  I'll then finish up with my implementation.  Lastly, 
feel free to email me for CAD models and more info.
</p>

<h3> The Motivation</h3>
<h4> Drawbacks of the Hbot</h4>
The H-bot design is straighforward, clean, elegant; yet it has an inherent design
issue that can throw the precision motion out of spec for all but the few H-bots 
made under very tight tolerances. To see why, we need to take a close look at 
the net forces acting on the moving axis.  Consider the following diagram below:

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="../../assets/img/Projects/coreXY/hbot.svg" width=500>
</p>
<!-- <img src="../../assets/img/Projects/coreXY/hbotFBD.svg" width=550 align="left" Hspace=10> -->

<p>
Suppose we'd like to move the platform in the <i>+x</i> direction.  To do so, we'd 
produce a torque <i>M</i> in each motor counterclockwise to produce the 
following forces on the platform.  Since belts only exhibit a force in tension, I've drawn a squiggly
arrow to represent a loose belt while a straight arrow represents a force 
<i>T</i> 
carried by a belt under tension.  From an ideal physics standpoint, the y-vectors
cancel, and the platform moves to the right in the <i>+x</i> direction. 
</p>

However, this motion occurs under the assumption that the moving axis is 
perfectly rigid, an assumption that doesn't make sense in the real world. 
To see where we start to have issues, we need to take a close look at 
the net forces acting on the moving axis.  Consider the following isolation 
diagram of just the moving axis below:
</br>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="../../assets/img/Projects/coreXY/hbotFBD.svg" width=300>
</p>

<p>
Taking the moving axis as a whole, we can see that the two belt tensions 
exhibit a net torque about the moving axis' center of mass. For this reason,
Hbots that aren't purely rigid will exhibit a flex. Furthermore, this flex 
isn't just present in left-to-right motion, but in <i> all linear combinations
of motion</i>.  It just so happens that the net moment is maximized when
the platform is moved purely left or right and zero when moved up and down.
</p>

<p>
If the tolerances are 
tight enough, this flex may be negligible; but in many high-end 3d printers
and other precision motion systems, this flex can limit the quality of 
the parts produced.  For a great example of this flex in action, take a look at
the prototype shown
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e7yy9u6QmA">here at 0:38</a>.
</p>

<h3> The Core-XY </h3>
<p>
The Core-XY happens to solve this net torque issue inherent to the H-bot. 
The Core-XY is a two-axis linear motion implementation developed at 
MIT Media Labs. The design itself is open source; nevertheless , at the time
of writing, it has yet to spread around the 3d printer community as 
common design choice. Overall, it delivers the same benefit of the H-bot,
a light moving platform, by keeping both motors fixed to the frame rather
than mounting one motor on the moving axis. Furthermore, by crossing the belt, 
the unwanted torque vectors are eliminated. To see why, let's take a look at 
the force vectors again. Have a look below:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="../../assets/img/Projects/coreXY/coreXY.svg" width=500>
</p>

<p>
Now Suppose we exhibit a moment <i>M</i> in both motors, Once more, the 
platform moves in the <i>+x</i> direction as expected. Again, the force vectors 
in the y-direction cancel each other out as well. However, this time,
<i>no net torque</i> is exhibited on the moving axis. For this reason, 
the moving axis does not twist in response to this motion.  
</p>

<h4> Implementation:</h4>
<p>
It's a small change in belt pattern, but it leads to a world 
of difference in the real world.  With a CoreXY design, an extremely 
rigid setup is no longer as critical a requirement as it was for an H-bot
design. Here's a brief walkthrough of some of the key features in this
low-cost implementation:
</p>

<div class="span9">
<h5> Pulleys:</h5>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="../../assets/img/Projects/coreXY/pulley1.jpg" width=400 align="left" Hspace=10> 
</p>
<p>
On the left, once again, budget pulleys are constructed from two discs of 
delrin sandwiching a conventional VXB ball bearing.  By placing a washer
between the bearing and the delrin discs, the bearing slides freely, 
guiding the pulley while maintaining belt tension. On the right, MXL pulleys
guide the toothed end of the timing belt.  Shoulder Screws hold them in place,
lubricated with a silicone lubricant. Nylon spacers handle the non-coplanar
offset of the second belt.
</p>
</div>

</br>
<div class="span9">
<h5> Set Screws:</h5>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="../../assets/img/Projects/coreXY/setScrew.jpg" width=400 align="left" Hspace=10 Vspace=10> 
</p>
<p>
I chose set screws to secure the shafts to the 80\20 angle plates. 
These screws offer the benefit of later switching to a design with 
slightly different dimensions.  
</p>
</div>


<div class="span9">
<h5> Non-coplanar belt:</h5>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="../../assets/img/Projects/coreXY/reuse.jpg" width=500 align="left" Hspace=10 Vspace=10> 
</p>
<p>
The Core-XY design relies on a non-coplanar belt path to drive the center
platform.  To handle the offset, the right motor, as well as its mating 
belt, are offset above the second belt. In this manner, both belts remain 
parallel to the plane about which the center platform moves. </br>
The plates are identical to those from the H-bot with a few extra holes
drilled into them.  Shoulder screws and silicone lubricant are 
responsible for the smooth motion.  All parts involved in the belt drive
were sourced from McMaster-Carr in this case.  
</p>
</div>

<h4>Results and Conclusion</h4>
Overall, the Core-XY remains true to its design principles. It's 
straightforward to build and eliminates the need for machined 
tolerances as tight as the H-bot. 
For the budget engineering student, this means that all of precision parts 
can be sourced from eBay, rather than a precision linear motion company. 
With that encouragement, I dismantled my H-bot and repurposed the components
to form a Core-XY design, and the results are just as expected. The moving 
axis no longer twists as it did with the H-bot, and I can get away with 
a working gantry machined within the tolerances capable of being made on our
CNC mill.
