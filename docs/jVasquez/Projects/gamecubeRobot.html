As opposed to our classic LED, laser diodes are a bit trickier to setup. 
First, they're a bit more sensitive to voltage spikes.
A static discharge can render a pricey diode now a useless trinket to add to 
the pile of nice-looking paperweights. 
Next, the reverse voltage can be as little as a few volts, which means
that plugging it into the system backwards can also fry it.   
Addiionally, laser diodes are heat-sensitive, and overheating them can also
lead to their destruction.  
</p>

<h3>A Note on Safety</h3>
<p>
Apart from the risks to the diode, the diode also poses a risk to the operator.
In a matter of microseconds, a rogue beam can render one blind permanently.
</p>

<p>
With this precaution, if you pursue this avenue of working with lasers, keep 
the risks in mind, make yourself aware of them, and wear <i>the right</i> 
goggles. By <i>the right</i> goggles, I'm referring to goggles that 
sufficiently protect against the wavelength that you're working with.

<p>
For this project, I've chosen goggles that are rated as OD6+ within the
445 [nm] range. The "OD" rating, refers to how many orders of magnitude by 
which the input laser power will be reduced before passing through the 
eyepiece. Thus, a 2[W] laser shining through a lense with an OD6 rating exits
through the other end with 2 microwatts of power.
</p>


<h3>The Driver</h3>
<IMG SRC='../../assets/img/Projects/laserDiodeDriver/schematic.svg' width="800" Hspace="10"></A>

<h4>Power Output</h4>
<p>
In many cases, the LM117 seems to be <i>the go-to</i> solution for driving 
small laser diodes. After all, its datasheet lists a simple circuit for 
reconfiguring it as a constant current source. I wanted to find a solution 
that could handle just a bit more current without the added complexity of 
designing a constant current source from scratch. With a bit of online catalog
hunting, I discovered the LM338, another adjustable voltage regulator that 
could source up to 5[A]. Like the LM117, the LM338 can also be  
</p>

<h4>Diode Protection</h4>
<p>
Because the laser diode is vulnerable to voltage spikes, I've added two diodes
to the output circuitry. The first is a zener diode, limiting the operating 
voltage of the diode to 4.6[v] and preventing voltage spikes in the forward 
direction. The second diode is a schottky diode, preventing voltage spikes 
in the reverse direction. 
</p>

<h4>Adding an Enable</h4>
<p>
With the intent of turning on the laser with a microcontroller, I've added an
enable with an n-channel  mosfet. 
However, because the mosfet is above the load and because a microcontroller 
operating voltage is only a few volts, A high-side driver is 
needed to turn the mosfet <i>fully on</i>. With the IR2101, the 
voltage at the gate is ensured to be substantially above the voltage at the 
source. while the input voltage now needed to turn on the laser is within 
the range of 3.3[v] logic.

<h3>An Etched PCB</h3>

<br>
</center>
<p>
In the spirit of 
making this project standalone and off the breadboard, I etched a 
double-sided pcb with copper(II) chloride (aka: cupric chloride). A surface
mount header provides easy interconnectivity with a microcontroller an external
power supply. Since the system only draws about 1[A], these header pins aren't
a bad choice for interconnectivity.

<p>
To cut out jumper wires entirely, I made two layers, and connected top and 
bottom with vias made by drilling holes and soldering snipped wire. For a DIY 
board, I'd recommend checking continuity as each via is created, since this is 
an easy spot for a cold solder joint. 
</p>

<h3>Results</h3> 
<p>
So far, the driver sources about 960[mA] and successfully drives a 2[W], 445 
[nm] diode from ebay. As time goes on, I'll be implementing a driver like this
one in a paper laser cutter project hopefully later this year.
