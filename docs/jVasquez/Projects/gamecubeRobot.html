<h2>Gamecube Robot in Disguise</h2>
<h4>or: building a budget drive train transmission from servo replacment gears</h4>
</center>
<br>
</div>

<div class="span9">

<p>
With yet another generation of game consoles on the horzion, what on earth will
we do with all of previous consoles?  Now backlogged by two generations, the
good ol' Nintendo Gamecube sits patienty in many closets. I decided that it 
deserved some fresh air, so I took mine apart and turned it into a robot.
</p>
<p>
Hmm, by robot, this Gamecube Bot is actually slightly more of an rc toy than
a robot in its current state. However, featuring a differential drivetrain,
it's just begging for great research to be done with it! 
</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>
Design a high-end research-worthy robot platform on-the-cheap? Challenge 
accepted. As many of us bot-designers over at HMC are learning, designing
a drive train transmission takes time. 
Why? For us, our biggest hump was choosing the gears 
needed for an acceptable gear ratio. With brushless motors revving up to 
10000[rpm], a transmission is vital to slow down that motor to an acceptable 
driving speed. 
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, choosing each gear separately from a supplier like McMaster-Carr
or SDP-SI can send us digging deep into our wallets. The solution? Find an
already-existing set of gears. In our case, a few of us have found that 
the HS-815/805BB servo replacement gears work shockingly well as a full
transmission for 8-to-12[lb] differential-drive bots.  
(I owe this trick to JB at the 
<a href='http://projectsbyjb.blogspot.com/2013/07/new-project-mini-combat-robot.html'>Secret Underwater Base / Machine Shop</a>,
 who gave it a shot first and sent me the gear CAD files!) 
</p> 
<p>
This is my first shot at seriously working with gears, apart from the classic
LEGOs of my past. The main principles are like so:
<ul>
<li> Gears of identical diametrical pitch can mesh together
<li> Gear ratios are given by the ratio of teeth between the driving and driven gears
<li> Gears mesh by mating their pitch circles tangent to each other. (Plus a wee-bit more space for added backlash)
<li> Common gears generally have the  worldwide-accepted pressure angle of 20 degrees
<li> Gears often come in standard Metric and US sizes. This is reflected in their pitch diameters
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Gears mesh at the imaginary circles called their pitch circles, a property 
derived from tooth count and pitch. 
</p>

<p>
To make the gear stage shape a bit easier to design, I created a Solidworks
Assembly using the gear files. I resized them to their pitch diameters and 
mated them tangent to each other so that I could freely position them while
ensuring that each stage touched the next. (One quick note: I actually made the
gears a wee-bit bigger than their pitch diameters, adding some backlash, to 
permit the gears to spin more smoothly.)

<p>
The pinion gear was a bit tricky to find. The servo replacement gears are 
metric, and finding metric pinion gears with the right inner shaft diameter
became another hunting game that I didn't want to play--especially if I 
happened to find the right gear from a limited line of one vendor's rc car. 
Luckily, 64-pitch US gears can mate with their metric cousins of comparable 
pitch, a feature that expanded the gear-selection wide enough to find the right
pinion gear. 
</p>


<h3>Machining</h3>
<p>
To ensure that the CAD files for the gear offsets would work, I made a quick 
test-plate with matching gear offets in the actual design. I was fortunate to 
catch small misalignment errors here, rather than in the actual part.
</p>

</center>

<p>
My first shot at press-fitting the servo gear shafts resulted in a crooked 
pin. Consequently, I made a second thicker plate with matching offsets but slip-fit
holes to hold the pins as I press-fit them into the frame.

Following the first transmission's completion and lubrication with silicone 
spray, we gave it a spin down in the shops. (That jiggly spacer was replaced!)

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
Once the two transmissions were created (correctly this time!), I zippy-tied
them together with a steel plate from an old hard drive. (Ah, having a scrap
pile is a lovely thing!) Following the crude assembly, we spun some initial
outdoor tests:

</center>

<h4>Signal Mixing for Differential Drive Control</h4>
<p>
The differential drive train is driven with two brushless motors, one per side.
Each of these brushless motors is driven by a brushless motor controller that
accepts PWM input signals from the rc receiver. Since each motor is controlled
by a separate channel, these channels must be mapped to a control-stick scheme
that makes sense; otherwise, the controls are  
offset by 45-degrees, making the driving experience a bit strange.
Rather than remapping the channel output signals with an 
embedded board like an Arduino, it's much cheaper
to place in a V-tail mixer cable between the two channels. (They're only $3.) 
(The video above is actually before I snagged a mixer.) 
</p>

<h3>Outlooks</h3> 
<p>
I'm thrilled that the servo-gear transmission works so well. In fact, with some
more effort, I'm convinced that a cheaper laser-cuttable edition is on its way
in the near future. For the budding Arduino hobbyist, this could be the 
beginning of an awesome new development platform with brushless motors. 
Alas, only time will tell. 

Also, now that I've got a hardware platform to work with outside the labs, I'd like
to give some budget mouse odometry a shot to see how well I can get it to track
it's position for future state-estimation projects.
