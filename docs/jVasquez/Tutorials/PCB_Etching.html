<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77947059@N05/11428759196/" title="CAN_Mod_Close by Poofjunior, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7380/11428759196_5b2f8188ff_z.jpg" width="640" height="361" alt="CAN_Mod_Close"></a>
</center>
      <h2> Introduction</h2>
<p> 
When I began the leap into digital electronics, I believed that the only limit 
to what I could design and build would be my imagination. I quickly 
learned,though, that it was actually the breadboard. 
I longed to spin my own boards for permanent projects, but 
I wasn't yet confident enough to take a breadboarded 
project, design a printed circuit board implementation, and send it 
out to be fabricated on a whim. 
</p>
<p>
To gain some confidence, I began etching boards to bring a project from start to
finish. While sending out the board is the real finishing point to a project, 
I've found that etching still has a place as a method of fast prototyping.</p> 
<p>
To the hobbyists, pcb etching enables us to communicate with a number of additional 
chips only available 
in surface-mount packages. It also enables fabrication of breakout boards for 
these surface-mount components for testing on a breadboard.  
</p>
<p>
Actually realizing this dream of etching DIY boards took two years to 
finally nail.  While a number of other electronics gurus make the process seem
straightforward, there are a number of undisclosed pitfalls that I learned
the hard way. As a result, I've done my best to outline my own workflow for
etching boards. I hope these notes serve future digital designers.
</p>
<p>
Etching boards is still an ongoing learning process for me. As I learn more, 
I'll continue to keep this page up-to-date.
</p>

<section id="Materials">
<div class="page-header">
<h2>Materials</h2>
<h3>Cupric Chloride: How not to annihilate the environment with every board</h3>
<p>
A number of hobbyists etch circuit boards with ferric chloride, a classic
and very effective etchant.  Unfortunately, the waste product of each board 
is toxic and unusable.  This waste etchant must be disposed through proper
hazardous waste management, a process that often involves a charge. 
</p>
<p>
An alternative to ferric chloride is cupric chloride.  Cupric chloride, 
aka copper(II) chloride, is formed by reacting hydrochloric acid with oxygen
and Copper. This process must be performed in a well-ventilated area 
(ideally: a fume hood) as the reaction can give off chlorine gas as well. 
The product: a solution of cupric cholride, can be used as an etchant. 
</p>
<p>
Cupric chloride has a strong advantage over ferric chloride for it's
renewability. Post-etching, the cupric chloride solution can be aerated to
be renewed and used for etching boards repeatedly. The reaction with copper
actually produces more etchant, effectively concentrating the previous solution
and resulting in faster etchings with the same solution. Yes, over time, 
copper(II) chloride dihydrate may precipitate when the solution becomes 
saturated.  At this point, some of the solution can be disposed of through 
hazardous waste management, and the rest can be diluted to continue etching
more boards. 
</p>

<h3>Toner-Transfer Material: Vinyl</h3>
<p>
The process of the toner-transfer method  is, quite literally, to take the
toner (dusty ink) from a laser printer and transfer it onto a copper-clad 
board. From that point, the copper beneath the surface of the toner will resist
being etched (removed) by the etchant when the board is bathed in the
etchant. All exposed copper will be etched away. Following the etchant bath, 
the toner can be wiped clean, exposing the untouched copper beneath. 
</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77947059@N05/11910243923/" title="Vinyl by Poofjunior, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7294/11910243923_47cdd0b8df_n.jpg" width="320" height="320" alt="Vinyl"></a>
<br>
</center>

<p>
Since it's not feasible to print the resist pattern directly onto a pcb, a 
decal of sorts (a transfer material) must be used as an intermediate step. The
process is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Print pattern out of toner onto transfer material.
<li> Transfer the toner off of the transfer material and onto the copper-clad 
board using heat.
<li> remove transfer material without leaving any of the toner on the transfer
material. 
</ol>
<p>
The process seems straightforward, but many transfer materials often perform
and imperfect transfer onto the copper-clad board, leaving small ripped pieces
of the pattern behind. A number of people have tried printing onto different
materials giving different levels of satisfaction. Originally, magazine paper
was the manner by which this process was done, since the toner would not 
adhere to the glossy surface of the magazine pages. However, very steady 
hands are needed to not smear the pattern as it is placed onto the copper-clad
board. Since slipping and smearing the pattern can become frustrating, other
transfer materials have been investigated. </p>
<p>
In my opinion, by far, vinyl (as in vinyl used by vinyl-cutters for sign-making),
is undoubtedly the most reliable transfer material. Since the pattern actually
weakly sticks to the vinyl, steady hands aren't needed to prepare the pattern 
to be transferred onto the copper-clad board. Furthermore, when heat is applied
to the vinyl, it becomes soft, readily permitting the toner to leave the vinyl
and adhere to the copper-clad board instead. The folks over at 
<a href='http://electroni-city.com/'>electoni-city.com</a> have made this
discovery, and they definitely deserve recognition for this find.
</p> 

<h3>Uber-Tiny Drill bits</h3>
To drill out the via and through-hole component holes, a set of tiny drill bits
will do the trick. Sizes 68 through 78 should work for most boards, though I 
typically only use three from the set: #68 and #70 for through-hole components 
and #72 for vias.  If inserting a tiny drill bit into a drill press or dremel 
chuck is a problem because of their width, these drill bits can also be 
purchased with an 1/8th-inch shank from McMaster-Carr.com, making them easier 
to clamp. Since drilling these holes takes some decent hand-eye coordination
that I don't always have,
I tend to try to stick to strictly surface-mount components and minimize the 
number of vias to overall minimize the holes that I'm drilling. (Believe it 
or not, when armed with tweezers, surface-mount soldering is actually easier 
than it looks, plus your boards look way more professional and have a thinner
profile from mostly flat components.)

<h3>Painter's Tape</h3>
Under high heat, other tapes tend to melt. Painter's tape, however, survives
the pattern transfer heating process without any problems. It also does the 
trick of sticking just securely enough to hold the pattern while also being weak 
enough to remove by hand. Finally, it softens under water, allowing it to be
more easily removed.

<div class="page-header">
<h2>Design Guidelines</h2>
<h3>Routing Angles</h3>
In developing a DIY board, it's best to avoid 90-degree angles. According to 
forums and a few others far more skilled that I, etchant tends to remain in
the corners, which corrodes the corners more noticeably than angles that 
do not have the 90-degree feature.  In the images below, I tend to route traces
with 45-degree bend such as those on the right-hand side.
<center>

</center>
<h3>Filling The Remaining Plane</h3>
<center>
<img src='../../assets/img/Tutorials/PCB_Etching/groundPlane.jpg' width="400">
</center>
<p>
With the <i>Polygon</i> tool in Eagle, I'll add a plane that is electrically 
connected to ground. This reduces etching time, since less copper is exposed 
to be removed from the board.  For a double-sided board, dedicating the bottom
plane to ground may reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI); however, that plane
cannot have any "moats" or other isolated sections to actually be beneficial.
</p>
<p>
Effectively reducing EMI involves far more complicated rules to abide by for
board layouts, but 
<a href='http://www.elmac.co.uk/pdfs/Lord_of_the_board.pdf'>this document</a>
gives an overview about some aspects to consider.
</p>
</div>
</section>


<section id="PatternTransfer">
<div class="page-header">
<h2>Pattern Transfer </h2>
<p>
For a double-sided board, aligning the board can be one of the trickiest 
steps. Once done correctly, the results are quite stunning. To perform the 
alignment, I use vias as alignment holes, which tends to work pretty well.
(Hopefully, if I'm doing a double-sided board, there are bound to be vias,
otherwise having a double-sided board starts to make a little less sense.
In that sense, there should always be vias to a double-sided board to 
use this same trick.)
</p>
<h3>Printing the Pattern</h3>
Remember that the design software board layout generally provides an "x-ray"
view of the board looking at it from the top through to the bottom. What this
means for printing is that the decals should be printed as follows:
<ul>
<li> The top layer is mirrored
<li> The bottom layer is unmirrored
</ul>
Before printing, hide all layers except:
<ul>
<li> top (repeat for the bottom, hiding top)
<li> vias
<li> holes
<li> board outline (optional)
</ul>
<h3> Alignment</h3>
<ol>
<li> Sizing is the first important issue here. To make the pattern easy to 
secure before entering the laminator, I will cut out the following sizes:
<ul>
<li> One pattern layer is just the right size to hold the entire pattern.
<li> The copper-clad board is slightly oversize with a border of about 0.05" 
to 0.1". 
<li> The other pattern layer is way oversize to hold everything together.
</ul>
<center>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77947059@N05/11789577763/" title="patternSizing by Poofjunior, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3744/11789577763_300e2630af_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="patternSizing"></a>
</center>
<li> Once the patterns and copper-clad board have been cut down to size, 
alignment holes must be made in each piece. I'll first choose (at least) two
vias. With a few sewing needles, I'll prick a hole into the pattern using 
cardboard as a base to hold the pattern as subsequent holes are made.
<center>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77947059@N05/11850029025/" title="AlignmentHoles by Poofjunior, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/11850029025_f1940d51ee_z.jpg" width="320" height="180" alt="AlignmentHoles"></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77947059@N05/11850467484/" title="MarkingReverseAlignmentHoles by Poofjunior, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7330/11850467484_fb4fd45a2a_z.jpg" width="320" height="180" alt="MarkingReverseAlignmentHoles"></a>
</center>
(Don't forget that both patterns must be pricked with consistent holes.)
<li> Next, the same holes must be then drilled through the copper-clad board. 
To do so, I'll color the copper with a sharpie by using one of the patterns as
a reference. By holding the pattern flat against the board, a thin sharpie will
bleed through the hole to the copper, marking the spot to be drilled.
<center>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77947059@N05/11850836136/" title="MarkingAlignmentHoles by Poofjunior, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2865/11850836136_0646b0a6cf_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="MarkingAlignmentHoles"></a>
</center>
Prior to drilling, I'll first make a small indent using a metal poking tool 
and a hammer. When drilling out the holes, the indent helps guide the drill bit
such that it begins drilling in the right location. 
<center>

</center>
</ol>
<h3>Securing the Pattern</h3>
<p>
Once the holes have been drilled, the three layers can be aligned and secured
with blue tape. I slide the needles through one layer just far enough to hold 
the other two layers, and then slip the other two layers in through the holes.  
I'll then push the ends of the exposed tips into cardboard to hold the pattern
as I secure it with tape.
</p>
<center>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77947059@N05/11850854646/" title="PatternTransfer1 by Poofjunior, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7329/11850854646_cf96d3fbcb_n.jpg" width="320" height="180" alt="PatternTransfer1"></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77947059@N05/11850061705/" title="PatternTransfer2 by Poofjunior, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5497/11850061705_904b45f1f5_n.jpg" width="320" height="180" alt="PatternTransfer2"></a>
</center>
<p>
When applying tape only apply it to three sides of the pattern, leaving one side
exposed to remain as a starting point for removal. I also recommend creasing 
the tape down onto the pattern to ensure that it doesn't slip as the three 
layers pass through the laminator for transfer.
</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77947059@N05/11850493474/" title="CreaseDetail by Poofjunior, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5488/11850493474_140a442815_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="CreaseDetail"></a>
</center>

<h3>Transferring the Pattern</h3>
<p>
I pass the pattern through a laminator about 4 to 5 times. Following this
procedure, I'll immediately submerge the entire piece in cold water to 
"flash-cool" the piece. This rapid cooling process helps transfer the pattern 
off of the vinyl as the vinyl contracts slightly in response to the temperature
change.
</p>
<center>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77947059@N05/11850365613/" title="PatternTransfer by Poofjunior, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7346/11850365613_c84dae4c5d.jpg" width="320" height="180" alt="PatternTransfer"></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77947059@N05/11850890466/" title="PatternTransfer2 by Poofjunior, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2894/11850890466_65994b7b73.jpg" width="320" height="180" alt="PatternTransfer2"></a>
</center>
<p>
The painter's tape can be sliced at the crease with an exacto knife. After the 
piece has cooled, I'll gently peel away the pattern under cold running water. 
</p>

<h3>Sealing the Pattern</h3>
<p>
The board, in its current state, can be etched, and will likely yield a 
working circuit (er, provided that the design is sound). However, etching a 
board in this state generally results in poor surface finish, as the etchant
tends to leak through the toner.  The solution? Seal this layer of toner with
<i>laser foil</i>. I first saw this trick performed by  
<a href='http://paulwanamaker.wordpress.com/perfect-single-or-double-sided-pcbs-with-the-toner-transfer-method/'>Paul Wanaker</a>. 
Laser foil isn't the only option here though. 
<a href="http://www.pcbfx.com/main_site/pages/products/toner_foils.html">pcbfx.com</a>
sells toner reactive foils that do the exact same thing. While this isn't an 
advetisement for their product, this Green TRF foil appears to perform the 
exact same task of sealing a board prior to etching. 
</p>
<p>
Laser foil fulfills the task of sealing the board from the etchant far better 
than simply the toner alone. The foil sticks exclusively 
to toner from laser printers, making it ideal for use in pcb etching via the 
toner-transfer method. (The original use of laser foil is for awesome 
craft-making like homemade shiny cards.) The image below shows two boards: one
etched with toner alone, and one board etched with both toner and laser foil
as a sealant. The results not only make the laser-foil-sealed board more
picture-worthy, they also preserve fine traces. 
</p>
<center>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77947059@N05/11792644356/" title="WithAndWithoutLaserFoil by Poofjunior, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3694/11792644356_4a161c21d7_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="WithAndWithoutLaserFoil"></a>
</center>
<p>
Notice that the upper board also has three splotches of fairly smooth copper 
where the pattern appeared to be well-sealed. As a test, I covered those areas 
with permanent marker prior to etching. Otherwise, they would've emerged pitted
 like the rest of the board.

<div class="page-header">
<h2>The Etching Process</h2>
<p>
Etching can be made faster under warm conditions (slightly above 30 degree C).
As <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Stop-using-Ferric-Chloride-etchant!--A-better-etc/">The Real Elliot</a>
and <a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/~eseychell/PCB/etching_CuCl/index.html">Adam Seychell</a>
explain thoroughly, the etching reaction occurs on the surface of the board
forming cuprous chloride. Consequently, agitating the board causes this thin 
layer of cuprous chloride to disappate off of the board surface and expose more
copper to the etchant.
