<ol>
<li>Always pull from the remote repository first, to make sure you have the latest code.</li>
<li>For large changes, work on a distinct <a href="http://gitref.org/branching/">branch</a>. When your done, and want to save changes, you can either
<a href="http://gitready.com/beginner/2009/02/02/push-and-delete-branches.html">save that branch up on the remote repository</a> or merge the working branch with the master and update the remote repository.</li>
</ol>

<p>Basic workflow will look like:</p>

<p>Pull down the latest changes:</p>

<pre><code>git pull
</code></pre>

<p>Make a new branch and switch to it with checkout:</p>

<pre><code>git branch cool_new_features 
git checkout cool_new_features
</code></pre>

<p>Do some work on that branch&#8230;</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re ready to commit, you have two options:</p>

<h3 id="option1:pushupthenewbranchthatyoureworkingon:">Option 1: push up the new branch that you&#8217;re working on:</h3>

<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m 'just started working on cool_new_features in a new branch'
git push origin cool_new_features
</code></pre>

<p>Git will save all of your branches in the remote repository if you add them.
Take care though: if a more recent version of cool_new_features is sitting in
the remote repository, just like with the master branch, you&#8217;ll have to git
pull to merge the more recent additions into yours before you can push up
your changes. Furthermore, since you&#8217;re now dealing with multiple branches,
you must specify where you&#8217;re pulling from. Thus, a scenario like this would
look like:</p>

<pre><code>git pull origin cool_new_features
git add .
git commit -m 'just started working on cool_new_features in a new branch'
git push origin cool_new_features
</code></pre>

<h3 id="option2:mergewiththemasterbranchontheremoterepository:">Option 2: merge with the master branch on the remote repository:</h3>

<pre><code>git checkout master
git pull
git merge cool_new_features 
git add .
git commit -m 'merged cool_new_features into master'
git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you can go back to working on the same branch by checking it out, or you can delete it altogether. When you&#8217;re done working on a branch, you can delete it with:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin --delete cool_new_features
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, to delete that branch locally on your machine, </p>

<pre><code>git branch -d cool_new_features
</code></pre>
