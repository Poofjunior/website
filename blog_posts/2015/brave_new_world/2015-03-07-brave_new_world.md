On the quest to build my next robot, no one mentioned that I was going to have metastability issues, noisy data, and __undefined references to main()__. (Look, bub, I just signed up for the robots–what’s with all this extra stuff I ended up learning along the way?)

To fellow tinkers, engineers, and DIY-enthusiasts, this brain dump of notes and tricks are for you. May they spare you many headaches in your future endeavors.

Cheers!
