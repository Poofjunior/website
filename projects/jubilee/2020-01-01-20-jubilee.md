## Intro

Jubilee is my homage to 3D printer hackers.
It's an XYZ motion platform with automatic toolchanging capabilities and interchangeable bed plates, and it's now a commercial kit.
Armed with Jubilee, you can explore everything from multimaterial 3D printing to gel extruding, to liquid-handling labwork, to inspection, to some combination of them all.
Best of all, it's open source, with a detailed set of step-by-step instructions.
If you've ever felt tempted to duct-tape something else onto the carriage of your 3D printer, Jubilee is for you--no duct tape necessary!

Arguably, if you landed on this page, you might've already heard about Jubilee at this point, so I wanted to frame this writeup as a reflection of the process instead of a showcase of what Jubilee can actually do.

## The Why

It's really tricky when I'd call this project "done."
Sure, I had an XYZ setup with a toolchanger and 1 tool working back in August 2019.
But I started tinkering with the idea a year before that back in the early 2018 summer.
And I didn't finish a satisfying draft of the instructions until Fall 2020.
Heck, I've been adding small tweaks through 2021 and parts of 2022!

## Prove Yourself Wrong

Back at my last job before grad school, one of my seasoned coworkers passed on some sage wisdom from his old lab PI.
As his prof put it: the difference betweeen undergrads and grad students is that undergrads try to prove themselves right while grad students try to prove themselves wrong.



In other words, there's a big difference between something working once and something working 24/7.
At the time, the comment was referring to the instruments that we were building for the factory floor, but they stuck around, and Jubilee is so much better for it.
For one, the REL was something that didn't just need to work once; it needed to operate over tens-of-thousands of cycles before asking for maintenance.
So when I first had a version of the REL that worked after a few tries, I started cycle testing late at night.
And with enough testing, I started to see it fail in bizarre ways.
Seven versions (and many cycle tests!) later, and we landed at something that works across thousands of cycles not just for me, but for most of the folks who pick up the online instructions and build one themselves.

## The Instructions
Really, this is the part of this project that I'm most proud of.
And making instructions for the tentacle workshop felt like the perfect warmup to this.

What I've discovered is that writing instructions is like shooting a scene in a movie.
You're trying to create a coherent flow through time to tell a story.
Here, that story is pretty simple.
This screw goes here. That nut goes there.

But something happens in professional videography that occurs so well that it's usually completely invisible to the user.
In a matter of seconds, the camera angles change from spot to spot and then maybe back again.
Each angle is only a few seconds of footage.
What's more, the footage is often shot at different points in time and then stitched together later to look like one continuous flow.

It's tempting to think that we get this sort of coherence just by pushing the record button the camera.
But that's not the case.
Every scene is carefully chosen to keep the user's attention on particular subjects in the field of view while making time feel like it's flowing continuously from one scene to another.
And when that illusion is broken, it's called a *jump cut*.
If you don't notice this, pick any television show or movie from the last 30 years, and count the number of times the camera angle changes over the span of 15 seconds.
<!--The result is the result of many takes of the same scene.-->
I'd make the case that writing instructions is all about doing the same thing.
It's about breaking down the assembly process in such away that offloads the "thinking work" from the user and putting it on paper.
If thes intructions are...
And if they're too detailed, then the builder's attention will glaze over and they'll miss something important.


Holding the builder's attention is hard, and making them do extra thinking work in their head can slow down the flow of the building process, which makes it less fun and more of a chore.

Jubilee is already complicated enough!

Mixing words and pictures is also tricky.
When the builder needs to read something, they need to do a conversion process in their head.
If there's something that can written that can also be depicted with a picture, I'll let the picture win.
(Donald Norman's "mappings." and "knowledge in the head vs knowledge in the world.")
This is primarily why I try to use words sparingly.


And they didn't happen in a vacuum.
As the project picked up steam online, and folks started building their own Jubilees, I got a tremendous number of questions and comments about the instructions.

I was getting overwhelmed, but addressing people's questions actually reduced the number of questions!
Questions changed. They became centered on other sections. They actually reduced overall.
It was rewarding to see a direct cause-and-effect relationship and it made the project feel like it was actually progressing.

What I discovered was that by changing the instructions in response, questions about a particular section would disappear, and new questions would emerge.


## The Whirlwind of it All

This project has so many feelings behind it, and I'm still not sure what to make of them all.
For one, it was a wonderful way to cap off 8 years of tinkering with hardware, starting with my early days back in the machine shops at Mudd.
It finally felt like I had something to give back to all the fellow basement tinkerers, something for them to stand on top of in exchange for all the notes I combed through on internet forums of people before me.

And on that note, Jubilee is a gift. It's a conduit to tunnel some of those joyful tinkering experiences to other people.
And this time around, you don't need a machine shop. You can do it all from your livingroom.


## How Do You Know What You Know

Empirically. I tested it.
Experientially. I have felt it.
Theoretically. I can refer back to undisputed principles that anchor it.


## The Agent in the Machine

I don't think of myself as an artist, yet something about creating and sharing open source work in this way feels intimate, and Jubilee really does feel like a reflection of *me* while simultaneously feeling like a performance of some craft I had been practicing.

And there was little grace through most of it.
Most of the time working on this project depicted an unsexy, haggardly figure hunched over a sketchbook, a computer, and eventually an automated fire hazard that's oozing plastic in a way that feels unsatisfactory.

It was trial-and-error while trying to learn from the mistakes.


## Your Turn
There's only so much you can learn from my rambles here.
To really step inside this project and find all those machine-building tricks, you'll need to thumb through the BOM, those instructions, and [build one yourself](https://www.filastruder.com/products/jubilee-motion-platform-kit?_pos=7&_sid=af733b86e&_ss=r).
I hope you have fun along the way.
